# 2D 4X

## I have ported this over to Godot and continued work on it here: [Godot 2D 4X](https://github.com/lordhaywire/2D-4X)

## Using Unity 2023.1.9f1

This is the repository containing the open source code for the game creation streams that Lord Haywire does on his KilledByDev [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/killedbydev) 
and [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@killedbydev) channels.
